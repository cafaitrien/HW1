    <h2> Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>
      Responsive design allows a website to dynamically adapt to different conditions.
      For instance, a website may adapt to the screen size of a device that the user is using to visit the site
      or the website may adapt based on the connection speed. From the point of view of the consumer, responsive
      design provides a flexible layout that allows them to have an optimal viewing/visiting experience regardless
      of the speed of their connection or the type of device being used. The developer can work toward ensuring the
      consumer has a consistent viewing experience and things work the way the consumer expects.  The example shown
      in class had a video autoplay only when the viewport is above a certain size. Also, we saw that some websites,
      such as NY Times have a mobile site and a web site – which due to having potentially different teams, you have
      different visions and versions of the page – thereby depriving the end consumer of a consistent viewing experience.
      Some of the biggest problems that responsive design solves are providing the consumer a consistent viewing experience,
      being able to handle the ever increasing number of different screen sizes and connection speeds, and ensuring the website
      has one vision, not a mobile and a web-based vision – which can lead to one type of site (mobile v. web) having functionality
      lacking in the other site.
